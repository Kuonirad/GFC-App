2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Kuonirad/GFC-App/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description of the proposed enhancement.
2. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most GFC-App users.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

### JavaScript Style Guide

We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style. Please ensure your contributions adhere to our ESLint configuration.

* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)

* Use template literals instead of string concatenation
* Use arrow functions for anonymous functions
* Prefer object shorthand for methods and properties

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use examples to illustrate complex concepts
