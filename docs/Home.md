## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the GFC-App API in Python:

```python
from gfc_app import GFCApp

# Initialize the app
app = GFCApp()

# Load an image
image = app.load_image("path/to/your/image.jpg")

# Generate animation
animation = app.generate_animation(image)

# Customize animation
animation.set_speed(1.5)
animation.set_color_palette("vibrant")

# Export
animation.export("my_awesome_animation.gif")
```

This code demonstrates how to **load an image**, *generate an animation*, and `export` the result using GFC-App.
