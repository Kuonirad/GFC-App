## Custom Animation Algorithms

GFC-App allows advanced users to create and implement their own animation algorithms. This feature provides ultimate flexibility in creating unique flux animations.

### Steps to Create a Custom Algorithm:

1. Navigate to the "Custom Algorithms" section in the app
2. Click on "New Algorithm"
3. Use our Python-based API to define your algorithm
4. Test and refine your algorithm using the built-in debugger
5. Save and apply your custom algorithm to your projects

Here's a simple example of a custom algorithm:

```python
def custom_ripple(image, time, amplitude, frequency):
    # Your custom ripple effect implementation here
    pass
```

## Batch Processing

For users working with multiple flux images, GFC-App offers a powerful batch processing feature.

### How to Use Batch Processing:

1. Select "Batch Processing" from the main menu
2. Choose the folder containing your flux images
3. Select an animation style or custom algorithm
4. Set global parameters for all images
5. Start the batch process

The app will generate animations for all selected images, saving time and ensuring consistency across your project.

## Integration with External Tools

GFC-App can integrate with various external tools to enhance your workflow.

### Supported Integrations:

- Adobe After Effects
- Blender
- Unity

To set up an integration:

1. Go to "Settings" > "Integrations"
2. Select the tool you want to integrate
3. Follow the step-by-step guide to establish the connection

## Performance Optimization

For complex animations or large batch processes, performance optimization is crucial.

### Tips for Optimizing Performance:

- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Adjust resolution settings for preview vs. final render
- Utilize multi-threading for batch processing

To enable GPU acceleration:

1. Go to "Settings" > "Performance"
2. Check "Enable GPU Acceleration"
3. Select your GPU from the dropdown menu
