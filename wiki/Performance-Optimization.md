# Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides tips and best practices for optimizing the performance of your GFC-App projects.

## Image Optimization

1. **Use appropriate image sizes**: Start with images no larger than 2048x2048 pixels.
2. **Compress images**: Use tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG to reduce file sizes without significant quality loss.

## Layer Management

1. **Limit layer count**: For best performance, use no more than 5-10 layers.
2. **Group similar layers**: Use layer groups to organize and manage complex compositions.

## AI Model Selection

1. **Start with simpler models**: Begin with less complex AI models and gradually increase complexity as needed.
2. **Use model caching**: Enable model caching in the settings to improve subsequent load times.

## Hardware Acceleration

1. **Enable GPU acceleration**: Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled in your browser settings.
2. **Update graphics drivers**: Keep your graphics card drivers up to date for optimal performance.

## Browser and System Optimization

1. **Clear browser cache**: Regularly clear your browser cache to ensure smooth operation.
2. **Close unnecessary applications**: Free up system resources by closing unused applications.
