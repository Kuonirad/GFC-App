# GFC-App Wiki Guidelines

## Purpose
This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to and managing the GFC-App Wiki. By following these guidelines, we ensure consistency, clarity, and ease of maintenance for our documentation.

## Version Control

### Committing Changes
1. **Make small, focused changes**: Each edit should address a single topic or fix.
2. **Use clear commit messages**: Begin with a concise summary (50 characters or less), followed by a more detailed explanation if necessary.
3. **Review before committing**: Double-check your changes for accuracy and formatting before saving.

### Reverting Changes
If a problematic edit is made:
1. Go to the Wiki page's history.
2. Find the last good version.
3. Click "Revert" to undo the problematic changes.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Structure
1. **Use consistent headings**: Follow the established hierarchy (H1 for page title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections, etc.).
2. **Keep it concise**: Aim for clarity and brevity in your writing.
3. **Use lists and tables**: Organize information in easy-to-read formats when appropriate.

### Formatting
1. **Use Markdown**: Familiarize yourself with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
2. **Code blocks**: Use ` ``` ` for multi-line code snippets, specifying the language for syntax highlighting.
3. **Internal links**: Use `[[Page Name]]` syntax for linking to other Wiki pages.
4. **External links**: Use `[Link Text](URL)` syntax for external resources.

### Images and Diagrams
1. **Use descriptive file names**: e.g., `installation-flow-diagram.png`
2. **Add alt text**: Provide a brief description for accessibility.
3. **Optimize file size**: Compress images to reduce load times.

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
1. Schedule quarterly reviews of all Wiki content.
2. Update outdated information and fix broken links.
3. Ensure consistency across pages.

### Handling Feedback
1. Encourage users to open issues for content suggestions or corrections.
2. Address feedback promptly and update the Wiki accordingly.

## Best Practices

1. **Stay objective**: Focus on facts and avoid personal opinions.
2. **Keep it up-to-date**: Regularly review and update content to reflect the latest changes in the project.
3. **Cross-reference**: Link related topics across different pages.
4. **Use templates**: Create and use templates for common page structures (e.g., feature documentation, API references).

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality, user-friendly Wiki that serves as a valuable resource for the GFC-App community. Remember, the Wiki is a collaborative effort, and your contributions are essential to its success!
